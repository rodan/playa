 This project should end up with the following feature set:

   - a smallish and spartan music player that can work for weeks between charges
   - a 2Ah Li-poly cell and an integrated charger - 5V input
   - decoding ogg files is a must
   - microSD (SDHC) is the storage medium. so fat32 and cards bigger than 4G should be supported


  there are 2 components in this repository:
  avr       - contains the Arduino code for the microcontroller
  hardware  - open source hardware for the main board (still in rough sketch form)
				the schematic is based on VLSI's Simple DSP Evaluation Board [1]
