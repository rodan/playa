 This project should end up with the following feature set:

   - a smallish and spartan music player that can work for weeks between charges
   - a 2Ah Li-poly cell and an integrated charger - 5V input
   - decoding ogg files is a must
   - microSD (SDHC) is the storage medium. so fat32 and cards bigger than 4G should be supported


  there are 2 components in this repository:
  avr       - contains the Arduino code for the microcontroller
  hardware  - open source hardware for the main board
				the schematic is based on VLSI's Simple DSP Evaluation Board [1]

  Library dependencies for the avr code:

  sdfatlib    http://code.google.com/p/sdfatlib/
  vs1063      https://github.com/rodan/vs1063
  IRremote    https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote

  Usage:
   - an RC5 remote control provides the control (a Vishay TSOP IR receiver output goes to avr.D2).
   - by default music files are played randomly. the REW button from the remote switches to album mode

  Power consumption profile:
   - jumper/switch open - battery connected only to the charging circuit - < 3uA
   - normal file decoding - 29-35 mA
   - standby (after STOP ir command), IR sensor active - 900uA
   - after uC woken up by ir sensor trigger, waiting for a POWER ir sequence (for max 2 seconds) - 4.5mA

  Known problems and limitations:
   - you should format the SDcard as Fat32 with 64k clusters
   - no special chars must be used in the filesystem entries, only ascii alphanumeric chars
   - there is a hardcoded MAX_PATH that only allows about 4 parent dirs to any music file

  Tested with:
   - 16G Class 10 Adata card, with ogg files over the 4G barrier
